                I am interseted in computer science,music,sport and movies.Computers first appeared in my life when i
                 was 13.Then i had got a laptop.I was palying it whenever i could.At first, I was just playing 
                 computer games,but some time later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with 
                 the computer, for example programming.
                 My dream is to study computer science and find a good job in IT.</p>
